## Constant Velocity Pedestrian Motion Prediction

This repository contains an implementation of the Constant Velocity Model from paper:

[The Simpler the Better: Constant Velocity for Pedestrian Motion Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07933)<br>
Christoph Sch√∂ller, Vincent Aravantinos, Florian Lay, Alois Knoll<br>
arXiv, 2019

In particular, it allows to reproduce the results for **OUR** and **OUR-S** from Table 1. The dataset in this repository is the same as the one provided [here](https://github.com/agrimgupta92/sgan), but converted to json format.
